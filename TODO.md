# TODO
## UI Refinements
### Homepage 
- The "index" written must be replaced with the "Keep+" title of the left menu, so remove from here
- The left menu must be collapsable, add the three lines button on the top left of the toolbar
- when collapsed, in the desktop and tablet must remain the icons of the list voices of the menu
- the search note bar must go on the toolbar for saving space in the workspace
- when I select the notes, i want that the action button appear in the toolbar in the right side

### Note Card (both edit and creation)
- remove the toolbar with the back button and the "note/[id]" title
- the header must be a cover image (something about with 150 px of height, but you can edit it) with the title input on it, placed on left botton side of it, then in the left upper corner the button arrow for come back and in the upper right corner the button for delete the note
- miss the link field after the content and before the tags
- if I press esc is like when i click on the back arrow

## BUG:
- when I try to select more items, i cannot: when i click in another note it open that and not select it
- when I create a new note, it saves multiple times in db with different step of the title, for example: 
  - i want start to typing "Title Example"
  - it create multiple note with titles: "T", "Tit", "Title " and so on
