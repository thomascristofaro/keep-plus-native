# TODO
## UI Refinements
### Home Page
- the top toolbar has two different height:
    - with the search bar
    - with the selection options
    I want to mantain always the same heigth (of the selection).
- the written of the selection and also the selection of the notes are not visible in dark mode (is black on blue background)
- the closed sidebar icons are too smaller

### Note Card (Create & Edit)
- for the content text input I want a background like the others input
- remove the "titles" of the fields and put them in the placeholder of the input, for example remove title "Cover Image URL" and put it inside the input field placeholder "Cover Image: https://example.com/image.jpg"
